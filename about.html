  <p>We are two CS students at Columbia named Ian Zapolsky and Ruchir Khaitan.
	 We wanted a place where we could share code, work on projects, and talk about
	 solutions together, so we made this place. If you see anything here that
	 strikes your fancy, feel free to visit the <a href="https://github.com/haikus-in-c">
	 haikus-in-c github</a> to see all the code featured here in its entirety, and the
	 theme for the site. Fork away!</p>

  <p>Ian Zapolsky is originally from Seattle, WA. He can also be found at
	 <a href="http://www.ianzapolsky.com">ianzapolsky.com</a> or his 
	 <a href="https://github.com/ianzapolsky">personal github page</a>.
