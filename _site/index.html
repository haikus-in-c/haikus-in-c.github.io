	</h1>

    <p><p>The concept of caching is simple: store something that is relevant to you in a
place that is close to you so that you can access it subsequent times in way
less time than having to go back to the original place you got it from again.</p>

<p>The world without caching would suck.</p>

<p>Imagine that you&rsquo;re in the library and you&rsquo;re writing an essay on someone.
Suddenly, you need to look something up about this person, so you go into the
stacks, find his biography on the shelf, read the information you need, put the
biography back on the shelf, and come back to your desk. Without the book.
This is the world without caching and it sucks because the next time you need to
look up something about the subject of your essay, you need to walk back to the
stacks and grab the book off the shelf again. Why not just bring the book to
your desk! Put it in your cache!</p>

    <p><p>Here&rsquo;s a poem that I recently, that I like more each time I read it. This blog
is called Haikus in C anyways, why not get some poetry on here!</p>

<p><em>All Watched Over By Machines of Loving Grace</em>
by Richard Brautigan</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="latex">  I like to think (and
  the sooner the better!)
  of a cybernetic meadow
  where mammals and computers
  live together in mutually
  programming harmony
  like pure water
  touching clear sky. 

  I like to think
  (right now, please!)
  of a cybernetic forest
  filled with pines and electronics
  where deer stroll peacefully
  past computers
  as if they were flowers
  with spinning blossoms. 

  I like to think
  (it has to be!)
  of a cybernetic ecology
  where we are free of our labors
  and joined back to nature,
  returned to our mammal
  brothers and sisters,
  and all watched over
  by machines of loving grace.
</code></pre></div>

    <p><p>Here&rsquo;s a fairly common scenario I have been running into this semester: I&rsquo;m
reading something in Spanish at the computer, I come across a word I don&rsquo;t know.
I look at it, contemplate looking it up, and continue reading. It&rsquo;s borderline
terrifying that I&rsquo;m so spoiled by the speed of modern technology that I consider
the time it takes to open a new browser tab, google my favorite Spanish-English
dictionary site, and enter the word I&rsquo;m looking for to be prohibitive, but I do.</p>

<p>But perhaps this superhuman level of laziness is what will ultimately drive the
next wave of technological advances necessary to achieve the ultimate informational nirvana
toward which the internet and modern search engine power is moving, a world
in which you can instantly recieve information about things you look at in real
time.</p>

<p>I recently decided to take my own small step toward this goal by writing two
simple but effective Google Chrome extensions to help optimize the process
of translating words and phrases between Spanish and English, and conjugating
Spanish and English verbs.</p>
