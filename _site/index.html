    <p><p>Writing as someone who recently came into the world of computer
programming, and is still very much in the process of learning how to code,
I think one of the biggest barriers of entry to new computer scientists is
the terminal. How are you supposed to write and compile your first hello world
program if you don&rsquo;t know how to navigate a filesystem without a
&ldquo;standard&rdquo; GUI? Some might say Eclipse, or another IDE, but I
say you&rsquo;d be cheating yourself out of a really important part of the general
CS education: a deep understanding of the UNIX terminal environment.</p>

    <p><p>Here&rsquo;s a fairly common scenario I have been running into this semester: I&rsquo;m
reading something in Spanish at the computer, I come across a word I don&rsquo;t know.
I look at it, contemplate looking it up, and continue reading. It&rsquo;s borderline
terrifying that I&rsquo;m so spoiled by the speed of modern technology that I consider
the time it takes to open a new browser tab, google my favorite Spanish-English
dictionary site, and enter the word I&rsquo;m looking for to be prohibitive, but I do.</p>

<p>But perhaps this superhuman level of laziness is what will ultimately drive the
next wave of technological advances necessary to achieve the ultimate informational nirvana
toward which the internet and modern search engine power is moving, a world
in which you can instantly recieve information about things you look at in real
time.</p>

<p>I recently decided to take my own small step toward this goal by writing two
simple but effective Google Chrome extensions to help optimize the process
of translating words and phrases between Spanish and English, and conjugating
Spanish and English verbs.</p>

    <p><p>I love drinking games.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re social, they&rsquo;re entertaining, but most importantly they have the unique
quality of making losing fun. Perhaps the most famous drinking game in the
world is beer pong, a game of which I am a strong proponent. However, beer pong
offers little in the way of statistics or information a computer scientist could
analyze to gain the upper hand: it all comes down to whether or not you can make
the shot.</p>

<p>There are other, more cerebral types of drinking games of course, that <em>do</em> offer
opportunties for <strike>cheating</strike> observation and analysis. Today I
would like the share one with you that I learned this past weekend in
Buenos Aires. As far as I can tell it does not have an official name, and there
very well may be a North American/English speaking version already being played.
It&rsquo;s great fun but, as we&rsquo;ll see in this post, it is completely unfair.</p>
