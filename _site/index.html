	<p><p>Recently I read an <a href="http://zachholman.com/posts/inbox-zero-everything-zero/">article by Zach Holman</a>, an engineer at Github and the guy
whose jekyll theme I adapted to build this site, about a simple (read: <em>very</em> simple)
todo script he wrote to keep track of his tasks. Here&rsquo;s how it works: any time you&rsquo;re at
the shell, you can type:</p>

<pre><code>$ todo thing-i-have-to-do
</code></pre>

<p>This touches a file at ~/Desktop/thing-i-have-to-do. Here&rsquo;s the code of the script itself.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="c">#!/bin/sh</span>
<span class="nb">set</span> -e

touch ~/Desktop/<span class="s2">&quot;$*&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Obviously, this tool assumes that the user keeps a tidy Desktop and cleans it regularly. Otherwise,
it just wouldn&rsquo;t be feasible to keep track of all the todo files. In his own words, <a href="http://zachholman.com/posts/inbox-zero-everything-zero/">Zach writes</a>,</p>

<blockquote><p>I keep a clean desktop: under three icons at a time, preferably. It made sense to use my
desktop as a kind of bucket I need to empty&hellip;.</p></blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, my desktop isn&rsquo;t so clean. I&rsquo;ve got all sorts of music and image files lying around,
in addition to miscellaneous stuff that&rsquo;s not related at all to programming. So, I decided to heavily
edit this todo script to accept several command line options that allow a user to set a priority for
a task (top &ndash; mid &ndash; low), print all the tasks in the todo list, organized by priority, and remove any
task. All the task files, which are the exact same empty files created with the touch command as in
Holman&rsquo;s original, are organized under one directory at ~/Desktop/todo. Within todo, there are three
more directories, todo/top, todo/mid, and todo/low. Each of these represents one priority category.</p>

<p>With my script, any time you&rsquo;re at the shell you can type:</p>

<pre><code>$ todo -t top-priority-thing
$ todo -m mid-priority-thing
$ todo -l low-priority-thing
$ todo other-top-priority-thing
</code></pre>

<p>The options -t, -m, and -l add a given task to directories top, mid, and low, respectively. If we run
todo without any option, our task will be automatically added to the top priority category. This is all
good, but we still have a problem when we want to peruse our list. It&rsquo;s all bundled up inside directories,
and none of us want to cd back and forth or fiddle with finder to see everything. That&rsquo;s where this
prompt comes in, which prints the todo list to the shell in an organized manner.</p>

<pre><code>$ todo -p
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming our previous input, this would return:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash">/// TOP PRIORITY ///
  - other-top-priority-thing
  - top-priority-thing

/// MID PRIORITY ///
  - mid-priority-thing

/// LOW PRIORITY ///
  - low-priority-thing
</code></pre></div>


<p>Boom! Finally, one last thing. Removing tasks is probably the easiest operation to complete using just
regular command line tools. However, for those who are lazy, there&rsquo;s this command, which deletes
any task you want, so long as you provide the priority directory.</p>

<pre><code>$ todo -r mid/mid-priority-thing
</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s all, a little todo tool to help you keep track of the stuff you&rsquo;re doing. Thanks to Zach for
getting the ball rolling. For those interested, here&rsquo;s the full version of my adapted todo script:</p>

	  <a href="/posts/jugglefest">Can You Yodle and Juggle at the Same Time?</a>
	</h1>
	
	<section class="byline">
	  by Ian Zapolsky, May 24, 2013
	</section>

	<p><p>In the careers section of startup <a href="http://www.yodle.com/">Yodle&rsquo;s</a> website, there are a couple programming
problems, one of which is called <a href="http://www.yodlecareers.com/puzzles/jugglefest.html">JuggleFest</a>. Here&rsquo;s a summary: given a
list of x circuits and y jugglers, where each juggler has a certain number of circuit
preferences ranked 1 &ndash; n, assign the jugglers to circuits evenly such that the number of
jugglers in each circuit is y/x and no juggler could switch to a circuit that they prefer
more than the one they are already assigned to <em>and</em> be a better fit for that circuit than
one of the other jugglers assigned to it. Whew.</p>

<p>We determine how good a match a juggler is for a circuit by taking the dot product of three
variables which they all share: Hand-eye Coordination (H), Endurance (E), and Pizzazz (P).
The higher the dot product of a juggler with a specific circuit, the better fit a juggler
is for that circuit.</p>

<p>This problem is a great exercise in designing an airtight algorithm from small scale to
large scale. The sample input provided by Yodle gives us 3 circuits and 12 jugglers,
while the actual text file required to solve the challenge has 2,000 circuits and 12,000
jugglers. Below is my process broken into steps. There is no code here due to its
length, but check out the whole solution on the <a href="https://github.com/haikus-in-c/haikus-in-c/tree/master/2013.5/juggle_fest">github</a>. Also note that I
refer to Circuits and Jugglers with their first letters capitalized to signify that these
are classes.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Read all Circuits and Jugglers into the program from an input file. This process can be
handled many different ways, but one important requirement is that we figure out the
total number of Jugglers and Circuits so we can determine the target number of Jugglers
that each Circuit should hold.</p></li>
<li><p>Assign all Jugglers to their first preference Circuits. I designed my Circuits so that they
contain two ArrayLists of Jugglers, one called jugglers, the other called overflow. Anytime
the jugglers ArrayList becomes full, any subsequent Juggler added to that Circuit is checked
against those already in jugglers. If it is better than none of them it is placed in overflow.
If the new Juggler <em>is</em> a better match for the Circuit than another Juggler, then the worst
match in jugglers is bumped down to overflow and the new Juggler is inserted in its sorted
position in jugglers.</p></li>
<li><p>Examine Circuits one-by-one and distribute the members of their overflow array (if there are
any) to the other Circuits. Repeat the following steps for each Circuit:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Find the worst matched Juggler in the overflow array.</p></li>
<li><p>Check this Juggler against its next preference Circuit.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If the Circuit is under capacity, add the Juggler to this Circuit immediately.</p></li>
<li><p>If the Circuit is at or over capacity, but the Juggler is a better match than one of the
Jugglers currently in the Circuit&rsquo;s jugglers ArrayList, insert it and kick the worst
performing Juggler down to overflow.</p></li>
<li><p>If the Circuit is at or over capacity and the Juggler is not a better match than one
of the Jugglers currently in jugglers, check against the next preference Circuit.</p></li>
<li><p>If this Juggler is not better than one of the Jugglers in its last preference Circuit,
check all Circuits for an under-full Circuit and add it there.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Sweep across all the Circuits, repeating steps 3-4 until they&rsquo;re all filled perfectly.</p></li>
</ol>

	<section class="byline">
	  by Ian Zapolsky, Apr 26, 2013
	</section>

	<p><p>Today we return to <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/jobs/tech/">Spotify&rsquo;s hallowed puzzle page</a> for the second of the three puzzles
they offer there. This one, the middle brother in between <a href="http://haikus-in-c.com/posts/spotify-programming-challenge-reggae/">Reggae</a> and <a href="http://haikus-in-c.com">Heavy Metal</a>,
is called <em>Funk</em>.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the problem: based on an input consisting of n songs on some album, where each song has its
own number of plays, we need to determine which song is the best (check the input format <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/jobs/tech/zipfsong/">here</a>).
However, while intuition tells us to assume the most played song to be the best, we have to take
into account something called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law"><em>Zipf&rsquo;s Law</em></a>, which states that the earlier songs on an album
(e.g. the first and second tracks) will be played more often than the later songs by nature of their position.</p>

<p>The law goes on to quantify this observation by saying that we should expect the nth song
of an album to be played roughly 1/n the number of times as the first.</p>

<p>I decided to approach this problem by designing a simple Song class to hold all the information
for a given song, including its plays, expected plays (based on Zipf&rsquo;s Law), and the ratio of
plays/expected plays. This ratio turns out to be the key to this problem because it measures the
popularity of songs not by play count (which for this problem is unhelpful), but by performance
of a song in relation to its expected play count by Zipf&rsquo;s Law. For example, if the first song on
an album has 100 plays, and the second has 51, then according to Zipf&rsquo;s Law the second is more
popular because it exceeds its expected number of plays of (&frac12;*100). Note that the first song
on an album will always have a plays/expected plays ratio of 1, because it is the first track&rsquo;s
plays by which we measure all the rest. So in this example, the first track has a ratio of 1 while
the second has a ratio of 1.02.</p>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve got this Song class, all we need to do is wrap up however many Songs we
have in an array or any other data structure that allows for quick iteration and sorting. I chose
array here just because of the relative simplicity of the sample inputs, but a linked list would
also be a totally valid choice.</p>

<p>Below is the main method, which reads input from the command line in the <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/jobs/tech/zipfsong/">given format</a>,
constructs an array of Songs, and then iterates through the array, setting the expected plays
and ratios of each song based on the number of plays of the first song. Then we sort by ratio
and return the first m songs (as specified in the input) in descending order of popularity.</p>

	</h1>
	
	<section class="byline">

	</section>

	<p><p>On <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/jobs/tech/">Spotify&rsquo;s puzzle page</a>, they&rsquo;ve got three tech puzzles for potential hires
to play around with. This is the first of them, whose difficulty is rated <em>Reggae</em>.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what we need to do: write a program to take some integer in decimal form
between 1 and 1,000,000,000 (inclusive), convert it to binary form, reverse that binary
string, and then convert the result back into decimal form. For example, on input 11,
we convert to binary number 1011, reverse to get 1101, then convert back to decimal form
to get 13 (11 > 1011 > 1101 > 13).</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s continue with 11. 11 is 1011, or (1*2<sup>3</sup> + 0*2<sup>2</sup> + 1*2<sup>1</sup> + 1*2<sup>0</sup>), in binary.
Why is this?</p>

<p>If we divide 11 mod 2, we&rsquo;ll get a 1, telling us the remainder of
11/2 and consequently whether the 1s place of 11 in binary form is 1 or 0.</p>

<p>Now, let&rsquo;s divide 11/2, rounding down to the nearest integer, which makes 5.
This division allows us to raise our modulous divisor by a power of 2, or shift left
one place in binary. When we compute 5 mod 2 what we&rsquo;re really seeing is the
remainder of 11/4 expressed in terms of 2. Notice that if we didn&rsquo;t divide by
2 here and simply doubled the modulous divisor, we would get our remainder in 1s, which
in this case would be (11%4 = 3), a very unhelpful number in binary.</p>

<p>The central idea is to find the remainder of the number you&rsquo;re converting (in this case 11)/2<sup>n+1</sup>
in terms of 2<sup>n</sup>, which will always either be a 1 or a 0, in order to find the value of the nth
binary slot from the right.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash">11%2 <span class="o">=</span> 1 --&gt; append to binary string: 1
11/2 <span class="o">=</span> 5
5%2 <span class="o">=</span> 1  --&gt; append to binary string: 11
5/2 <span class="o">=</span> 2
2%2 <span class="o">=</span> 0  --&gt; append to binary string: 011
2/2 <span class="o">=</span> 1
1%2 <span class="o">=</span> 1  --&gt; append to binary string: 1011
1/2 <span class="o">=</span> 0  --&gt; stop because we reach 0
</code></pre></div>


<p>Notice that the example above appends new 1s and 0s <em>to the left</em>. This means that if we were
to append to the right in a method, as I do below, it would yield an already-reversed binary string,
thus killing two birds with one piece of code!</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="java"><span class="n">String</span> <span class="nf">convertDecimalToReversedBinary</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">value</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
        <span class="n">result</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="o">+(</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="o">%</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">);</span>
        <span class="n">value</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">result</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Now, all we need is a method to convert a binary string back into an integer. This isn&rsquo;t
hard, as we already know how binary strings are put together. My method works backwards
from the end of the String, adding increasing powers of 2 to a final result.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="java"><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">convertBinaryToDecimal</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">binary</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">value</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">count</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">binary</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">length</span><span class="o">()-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">);</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">;</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">--)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">binary</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">charAt</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="sc">&#39;1&#39;</span><span class="o">)</span>
            <span class="n">value</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="n">Math</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">pow</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">count</span><span class="o">);</span>
        <span class="n">count</span><span class="o">++;</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>And that&rsquo;s it! We solved the first Spotify programming challenge.</p>
