	  <a href="/posts/jugglefest">Can You Yodle and Juggle at the Same Time?</a>
	</h1>
	
	<section class="byline">

	</section>

	<p><p>In the careers section of startup <a href="http://www.yodle.com/">Yodle&rsquo;s</a> website, there are a couple programming
problems, one of which is called <a href="http://www.yodlecareers.com/puzzles/jugglefest.html">JuggleFest</a>. Here&rsquo;s a summary: given a
list of x circuits and y jugglers, where each juggler has a certain number of circuit
preferences ranked 1 &ndash; n, assign the jugglers to circuits evenly such that the number of
jugglers in each circuit is y/x and no juggler could switch to a circuit that they prefer
more than the one they are already assigned to <em>and</em> be a better fit for that circuit than
one of the other jugglers assigned to it. Whew.</p>

<p>We determine how good a match a juggler is for a circuit by taking the dot product of three
variables which they all share: Hand-eye Coordination (H), Endurance (E), and Pizzazz (P).
The higher the dot product of a juggler with a specific circuit, the better fit a juggler
is for that circuit.</p>

<p>This problem is a great exercise in designing an airtight algorithm from small scale to
large scale. The sample input provided by Yodle gives us 3 circuits and 12 jugglers,
while the actual text file required to solve the challenge has 2,000 circuits and 12,000
jugglers. Below is my process broken into steps. There is no code here due to its
length, but check out the whole solution on the <a href="https://github.com/haikus-in-c/haikus-in-c/tree/master/2013.5/juggle_fest">github</a>. Also note that I
refer to Circuits and Jugglers with their first letters capitalized to signify that these
are classes.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Read all Circuits and Jugglers into the program from an input file. This process can be
handled many different ways, but one important requirement is that we figure out the
total number of Jugglers and Circuits so we can determine the target number of Jugglers
that each Circuit should hold.</p></li>
<li><p>Assign all Jugglers to their first preference Circuits. I designed my Circuits so that they
contain two ArrayLists of Jugglers, one called jugglers, the other called overflow. Anytime
the jugglers ArrayList becomes full, any subsequent Juggler added to that Circuit is checked
against those already in jugglers. If it is better than none of them it is placed in overflow.
If the new Juggler <em>is</em> a better match for the Circuit than another Juggler, then the worst
match in jugglers is bumped down to overflow and the new Juggler is inserted in its sorted
position in jugglers.</p></li>
<li><p>Examine Circuits one-by-one and distribute the members of their overflow array (if there are
any) to the other Circuits. Repeat the following steps for each Circuit:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Find the worst matched Juggler in the overflow array.</p></li>
<li><p>Check this Juggler against its next preference Circuit.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If the Circuit is under capacity, add the Juggler to this Circuit immediately.</p></li>
<li><p>If the Circuit is at or over capacity, but the Juggler is a better match than one of the
Jugglers currently in the Circuit&rsquo;s jugglers ArrayList, insert it and kick the worst
performing Juggler down to overflow.</p></li>
<li><p>If the Circuit is at or over capacity and the Juggler is not a better match than one
of the Jugglers currently in jugglers, check against the next preference Circuit.</p></li>
<li><p>If this Juggler is not better than one of the Jugglers in its last preference Circuit,
check all Circuits for an under-full Circuit and add it there.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Sweep across all the Circuits, repeating steps 3-4 until they&rsquo;re all filled perfectly.</p></li>
</ol>

	<section class="byline">

	</section>

	<p><p>On <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/jobs/tech/">Spotify&rsquo;s puzzle page</a>, they&rsquo;ve got three tech puzzles for potential hires
to play around with. This is the first of them, whose difficulty is rated <em>Reggae</em>.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what we need to do: write a program to take some integer in decimal form
between 1 and 1,000,000,000 (inclusive), convert it to binary form, reverse that binary
string, and then convert the result back into decimal form. For example, on input 11,
we convert to binary number 1011, reverse to get 1101, then convert back to decimal form
to get 13 (11 > 1011 > 1101 > 13).</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s continue with 11. 11 is 1011, or (1*2<sup>3</sup> + 0*2<sup>2</sup> + 1*2<sup>1</sup> + 1*2<sup>0</sup>), in binary.
Why is this?</p>

<p>If we divide 11 mod 2, we&rsquo;ll get a 1, telling us the remainder of
11/2 and consequently whether the 1s place of 11 in binary form is 1 or 0.</p>

<p>Now, let&rsquo;s divide 11/2, rounding down to the nearest integer, which makes 5.
This division allows us to raise our modulous divisor by a power of 2, or shift left
one place in binary. When we compute 5 mod 2 what we&rsquo;re really seeing is the
remainder of 11/4 expressed in terms of 2. Notice that if we didn&rsquo;t divide by
2 here and simply doubled the modulous divisor, we would get our remainder in 1s, which
in this case would be (11%4 = 3), a very unhelpful number in binary.</p>

<p>The central idea is to find the remainder of x/2<sup>n+1</sup> in terms of 2<sup>n</sup> in order
to find out if the nth binary slot from the right is a 0 or a 1.</p>

</code></pre></div>


<p>Notice that the example above appends new 1s and 0s <em>to the left</em>. This means that if we were
to append to the right in a method, as I do below, it would yield an already-reversed binary string,
thus killing two birds with one piece of code!</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="java"><span class="n">String</span> <span class="nf">convertDecimalToReversedBinary</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">value</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
        <span class="n">result</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="o">+(</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="o">%</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">);</span>
        <span class="n">value</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">result</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Now, all we need is a method to convert a binary string back into an integer. This isn&rsquo;t
hard, as we already know how binary strings are put together. My method works backwards
from the end of the String, adding increasing powers of 2 to a final result.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="java"><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">convertBinaryToDecimal</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">binary</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">value</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">count</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">binary</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">length</span><span class="o">()-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">);</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">;</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">--)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">binary</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">charAt</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="sc">&#39;1&#39;</span><span class="o">)</span>
