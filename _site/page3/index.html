    <p><p>Today&rsquo;s puzzle is an exercise in recursion and iteration, and the costs and benefits of both. The task is simple, given a triangle of numbers, here defined as an arrangement of numbers where the first row has one number, the second row has two, and the nth row has n numbers, the task is to find the maximum total going from top to bottom using only adjacent numbers, or the maximum path sum. A sample triangle and top down path are shown below. The challenge is to do this for a large triangle, with at least a hundred rows, where there are so many top down paths that brute force solutions are impossible.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="latex">        1           max path: 1
      3   5                   5 
    6   7   2                 7
                    total:   13 
</code></pre></div>


<p>There are two key questions that need to be answered in order to solve this problem. Firstly, how are we going to represent the triangle so that the program can use the data? One initially attractive solution is to use a tree structure, since the shape of a triangle suggests a tree almost immediately and each node would only have two children. However, this approach falls short, as though each parent node would have two child nodes, most of those nodes would be shared between two parents, which could lead to memory usage and implementation complications. Instead, lets examine what we know. We know that each triangle will only ever have n rows, and that each nth row will have n numbers. This means that if the triangle is represented as a text file, then just by counting the number of lines we can know that there will be n(n+1)/2 elements, which can be stored in an array.</p>

    <p><p>Recently I spent some time wading through the internet&rsquo;s primordial soup of CS help sources &ndash; Stack
Overflow commments, random blogs (like this one!), and source documentation that leaves something to
be desired &ndash; to set up this site, which is hosted on Github Pages with a custom domain. I&rsquo;ve since
decided to migrate the hosting of my <a href="http://ianzapolsky.com/">personal website</a> to Github Pages as well,
because it&rsquo;s such a great platform and allows for almost instantatneous editing and changing. Instead
of using clumsy cPanels and browser-based editors, you can just make edits to your site files
locally in whatever text editor you want, add, commit, push, and it&rsquo;s live. However, there are
a couple tricky spots to getting your custom domain Github Pages hosted site up and running.
But since I&rsquo;ve done this setup process twice now, I&rsquo;m going to cover it from scratch,
so I can garuntee that by the end of this, your website will work too!</p>

    <p><p>Recently I read an <a href="http://zachholman.com/posts/inbox-zero-everything-zero/">article by Zach Holman</a>, an engineer at Github and the guy
whose jekyll theme I adapted to build this site, about a simple (read: <em>very</em> simple)
todo script he wrote to keep track of his tasks. Here&rsquo;s how it works: any time you&rsquo;re at
the shell, you can type:</p>

<pre><code>$ todo thing-i-have-to-do
</code></pre>

<p>This touches a file at ~/Desktop/thing-i-have-to-do. Here&rsquo;s the code of the script itself.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="c">#!/bin/sh</span>
<span class="nb">set</span> -e

touch ~/Desktop/<span class="s2">&quot;$*&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Obviously, this tool assumes that the user keeps a tidy Desktop and cleans it regularly. Otherwise,
it just wouldn&rsquo;t be feasible to keep track of all the todo files. In his own words, <a href="http://zachholman.com/posts/inbox-zero-everything-zero/">Zach writes</a>,</p>

<blockquote><p>I keep a clean desktop: under three icons at a time, preferably. It made sense to use my
desktop as a kind of bucket I need to empty&hellip;.</p></blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, my desktop isn&rsquo;t so clean.</p>
