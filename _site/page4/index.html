    <p><p>In the careers section of startup <a href="http://www.yodle.com/">Yodle&rsquo;s</a> website, there are a couple programming
problems, one of which is called <a href="http://www.yodlecareers.com/puzzles/jugglefest.html">JuggleFest</a>. Here&rsquo;s a summary: given a
list of x circuits and y jugglers, where each juggler has a certain number of circuit
preferences ranked 1 &ndash; n, assign the jugglers to circuits evenly such that the number of
jugglers in each circuit is y/x and no juggler could switch to a circuit that they prefer
more than the one they are already assigned to <em>and</em> be a better fit for that circuit than
one of the other jugglers assigned to it. Whew.</p>

<p>We determine how good a match a juggler is for a circuit by taking the dot product of three
variables which they all share: Hand-eye Coordination (H), Endurance (E), and Pizzazz (P).
The higher the dot product of a juggler with a specific circuit, the better fit a juggler
is for that circuit.</p>

    <p><p>Today we return to <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/jobs/tech/">Spotify&rsquo;s hallowed puzzle page</a> for the second of the three puzzles
they offer there. This one, the middle brother in between <a href="http://haikus-in-c.com/posts/spotify-programming-challenge-reggae/">Reggae</a> and <a href="http://haikus-in-c.com">Heavy Metal</a>,
is called <em>Funk</em>.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the problem: based on an input consisting of n songs on some album, where each song has its
own number of plays, we need to determine which song is the best (check the input format <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/jobs/tech/zipfsong/">here</a>).
However, while intuition tells us to assume the most played song to be the best, we have to take
into account something called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law"><em>Zipf&rsquo;s Law</em></a>, which states that the earlier songs on an album
(e.g. the first and second tracks) will be played more often than the later songs by nature of their position.</p>

<p>The law goes on to quantify this observation by saying that we should expect the nth song
of an album to be played roughly 1/n the number of times as the first.</p>

    <p><p>On <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/jobs/tech/">Spotify&rsquo;s puzzle page</a>, they&rsquo;ve got three tech puzzles for potential hires
to play around with. This is the first of them, whose difficulty is rated <em>Reggae</em>.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what we need to do: write a program to take some integer in decimal form
between 1 and 1,000,000,000 (inclusive), convert it to binary form, reverse that binary
string, and then convert the result back into decimal form. For example, on input 11,
we convert to binary number 1011, reverse to get 1101, then convert back to decimal form
to get 13 (11 > 1011 > 1101 > 13).</p>
