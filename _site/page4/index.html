    <p><p>Recently I spent some time wading through the internet&rsquo;s primordial soup of CS help sources &ndash; Stack
Overflow commments, random blogs (like this one!), and source documentation that leaves something to
be desired &ndash; to set up this site, which is hosted on Github Pages with a custom domain. I&rsquo;ve since
decided to migrate the hosting of my <a href="http://ianzapolsky.com/">personal website</a> to Github Pages as well,
because it&rsquo;s such a great platform and allows for almost instantatneous editing and changing. Instead
of using clumsy cPanels and browser-based editors, you can just make edits to your site files
locally in whatever text editor you want, add, commit, push, and it&rsquo;s live. However, there are
a couple tricky spots to getting your custom domain Github Pages hosted site up and running.
But since I&rsquo;ve done this setup process twice now, I&rsquo;m going to cover it from scratch,
so I can garuntee that by the end of this, your website will work too!</p>

    <p><p>Recently I read an <a href="http://zachholman.com/posts/inbox-zero-everything-zero/">article by Zach Holman</a>, an engineer at Github and the guy
whose jekyll theme I adapted to build this site, about a simple (read: <em>very</em> simple)
todo script he wrote to keep track of his tasks. Here&rsquo;s how it works: any time you&rsquo;re at
the shell, you can type:</p>

<pre><code>$ todo thing-i-have-to-do
</code></pre>

<p>This touches a file at ~/Desktop/thing-i-have-to-do. Here&rsquo;s the code of the script itself.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="c">#!/bin/sh</span>
<span class="nb">set</span> -e

touch ~/Desktop/<span class="s2">&quot;$*&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Obviously, this tool assumes that the user keeps a tidy Desktop and cleans it regularly. Otherwise,
it just wouldn&rsquo;t be feasible to keep track of all the todo files. In his own words, <a href="http://zachholman.com/posts/inbox-zero-everything-zero/">Zach writes</a>,</p>

<blockquote><p>I keep a clean desktop: under three icons at a time, preferably. It made sense to use my
desktop as a kind of bucket I need to empty&hellip;.</p></blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, my desktop isn&rsquo;t so clean.</p>

    <p><p>In the careers section of startup <a href="http://www.yodle.com/">Yodle&rsquo;s</a> website, there are a couple programming
problems, one of which is called <a href="http://www.yodlecareers.com/puzzles/jugglefest.html">JuggleFest</a>. Here&rsquo;s a summary: given a
list of x circuits and y jugglers, where each juggler has a certain number of circuit
preferences ranked 1 &ndash; n, assign the jugglers to circuits evenly such that the number of
jugglers in each circuit is y/x and no juggler could switch to a circuit that they prefer
more than the one they are already assigned to <em>and</em> be a better fit for that circuit than
one of the other jugglers assigned to it. Whew.</p>

<p>We determine how good a match a juggler is for a circuit by taking the dot product of three
variables which they all share: Hand-eye Coordination (H), Endurance (E), and Pizzazz (P).
The higher the dot product of a juggler with a specific circuit, the better fit a juggler
is for that circuit.</p>
