  <p>Here&rsquo;s a poem that I recently, that I like more each time I read it. This blog
is called Haikus in C anyways, why not get some poetry on here!</p>

<p><em>All Watched Over By Machines of Loving Grace</em>
by Richard Brautigan</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="latex">  I like to think (and
  the sooner the better!)
  of a cybernetic meadow
  where mammals and computers
  live together in mutually
  programming harmony
  like pure water
  touching clear sky. 

  I like to think
  (right now, please!)
  of a cybernetic forest
  filled with pines and electronics
  where deer stroll peacefully
  past computers
  as if they were flowers
  with spinning blossoms. 

  I like to think
  (it has to be!)
  of a cybernetic ecology
  where we are free of our labors
  and joined back to nature,
  returned to our mammal
  brothers and sisters,
  and all watched over
  by machines of loving grace.
</code></pre></div>

<p>The phrase &ldquo;Software is eating the world&rdquo; is being <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/benkepes/2013/10/23/enabling-software-to-eat-the-world-one-api-at-a-time/">thrown</a> <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/11/14/softwares-eating-the-world-and-devs-are-serving-up-the-meal/">around</a>
<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/14/as-software-eats-the-world-non-tech-corporations-are-eating-startups/">a lot</a> on the internet these days, ever since Marc Andreessen coined it in a
<a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">Wall Street Journal essay</a> from 2011.</p>

<p>I believe in the idea, but I think that software has only taken its first bite
in what will be a massive feast spanning hundreds of years. Software has already
become a part of billions of people&rsquo;s lives, whether it touches them directly
or not (i.e. via a device/web browser), and yet there are so many places where
software and computing power will be in just a handful of years where it is not
right now. Intel&rsquo;s Newton computer and other products like it are going to
introduce the element of computer &ldquo;intelligence,&rdquo; or programmable behavior, into
more and more corners of our existence (see the Nest thermostat, the automated
car, the internet fridge). We&rsquo;re going to continue to speed things up, make
things more autonomous, and we&rsquo;re going to use computers to do it.</p>

<p>This is really exciting.</p>

<p>Brautigan&rsquo;s poem describes a potential endstate of this process, a serene utopia
where software is so pervasive that it has become our guardian. Humanity is
free to forget problems it once concerned itself with, safe in the
hands of the machines it has created to solve them. I&rsquo;m not sure I can fully
believe in this eventuality. For one thing, I think there will always be bugs.
No matter how big the system, no matter how refined, there will always be bugs
because humans are not perfect, and at the end of the day, humans write
software.</p>
